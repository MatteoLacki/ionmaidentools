# AI.md — ionmaidentools

## What this repo is

`src/ionmaidentools/pipelines.py` is the necroflow pipeline factory for the ionmaiden
DIA timsTOF pipeline — the single module every job TOML's `.pipeline` key points at
(e.g. `git/ionmaidentools/src/ionmaidentools/pipelines.py:ionmaiden_pipeline`). It has
no other source files: one large module, `NodeType` subclasses + `@command`-decorated
rule functions + two top-level pipeline factory functions.

Package metadata (`pyproject.toml`): depends on `tomlkit` + `dictodot`, no CLI entry
points registered — this package is imported by necroflow's job runner (`./nf`, i.e.
`.venv/bin/necroflow`), not invoked directly.

## Necroflow rule conventions (as used here)

- A rule is a plain function decorated `@command("<shell template with {placeholders}>")`.
  Parameters annotated with a `NodeType` subclass are DAG-edge inputs (parent nodes);
  plain-typed parameters (`str`, `int`, `float`) are scalar config/CLI-flag inputs, not
  DAG edges.
- `output(SomeNodeType)` inside the function body declares a typed output node; its
  placeholder is substituted into the shell template. The function returns the output
  node(s).
- Pipeline factories (`ionmaiden_pipeline(P, config)`, `fragpipe_synthetic_pipeline(P, config)`)
  wire rules together: `P.some_label = some_rule(P, parent_node, ..., scalar_kwarg=...)`.
  The first positional arg is always the `Pipeline` object `P`.
- Every rule shells out to a real installed/patched CLI directly — no bespoke Python
  wrapper CLIs. External tools live at fixed, pre-installed paths (`software/sage/devel_fixed`,
  `software/fragpipe/fragpipe-24.0`), same convention on both sides.
- See root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Precursor table format" — all precursor tables in this pipeline
  are `.mmappet` directories (`MmappetDataset` subclasses here), never intermediate parquet.

## Two pipeline factories

- `ionmaiden_pipeline`: the real pipeline — Bruker `.d` → MS1 peak picking → quadrupole
  transmission → pseudo-MS/MS → SAGE search (+ optional recalibration pass, optional
  FragPipe side-by-side comparison when the job config has a `[fragpipe]` section).
- `fragpipe_synthetic_pipeline`: FragPipe smoke test on Koina-simulated peptides from a
  FASTA (no Bruker `.d` input, no Sage) — reuses `ionmaiden_pipeline`'s FragPipe rules
  verbatim (`source_fragpipe_workflow`/`generate_fragpipe_decoy_fasta`/
  `patch_fragpipe_workflow`/`write_fragpipe_manifest`/`run_fragpipe`/`extract_fragpipe_log`/
  `summarize_fragpipe`).

## Conventions to follow when editing this file

- Design rationale, migration history, and "why this and not that" reasoning belongs
  here (or in this repo's own future notes), **not** in `pipelines.py` docstrings —
  keep code docstrings about what the code does now, not why it changed.
- FragPipe's `.workflow` file is a hand-maintained flat `key=value` properties file
  (`configs/search/fragpipe/workflows/*.workflow`), symlinked in as-is by
  `source_fragpipe_workflow`. `patch_fragpipe_workflow` derives a copy with
  `database.db-path=` rewritten (via `sed`) to point at `generate_fragpipe_decoy_fasta`'s
  output, so `run_fragpipe` always searches against a decoy-augmented FASTA — this is
  the one exception to "never patched", added because FragPipe/Philosopher has no
  generate-decoys-at-search-time option (unlike Sage) and there's no CLI override flag
  for it.
